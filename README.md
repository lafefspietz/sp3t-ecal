# [sp3t-ecal](https://github.com/lafefspietz/sp3t-ecal)

Open source MEMS-based single pole three throw circuit board with improved impedance matching and SMA launches. This is in a rough draft status now, and is in active development.  This is to become a part of a system which will have two of these switch boards and a set of breakout baords for connecting the DC control lines to these RF switch boards, and to then connect to the 25 pin mirco D which is standard in most cryogenic systems used for superconducting quantum systems. Board is 50 mm square.
